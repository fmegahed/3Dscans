This repo contains the simulation and case study code used in Wells, L. J., Megahed, F. M., Niziolek, C. B., Camelio, J. A., &amp; Woodall, W. H. (2013). Statistical process monitoring approach for high-density point clouds. Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 24(6), 1267-1279. This code was added to GitHub approximately 8-9 years from when the work was done so my apologies for any missing documentation. I used to share Dropbox links with readers and this is a better long-term approach. These two folders were shared with several researchers via email links in the past.
